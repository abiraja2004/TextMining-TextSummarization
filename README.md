# TextMining-TextSummarization
An automatic summarization is needed to help users extract the most important pieces of information from the vast amount of text digitized into electronic form every day. In this paper we propose to make use of different similarity measures at the same time for text summarization task. We calculate different similarity measures based on sentiment and continuous vector space model representations. Then we use these measures along with classical TfxIdf similarity. Continuous vector representations make our system semantically aware of representations of sentences. And sentiment gives a bias to sentences that is loaded with sentiment. We evaluate our results with Rouge package with different parameters and compositions.
